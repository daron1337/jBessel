Description: jBessel
        ~~~~~~~~~
        
        This cython module computes bessel functions of the first 
        kind (J) for integers order n (0,1,2).
        
        Once it has been installed, you can import it as a standard python module.
        
        Bessel functions of the first kind, denoted as Ja(x), are solutions of Bessel's 
        differential equation that are finite at the origin (x = 0) for integer a, and 
        diverge as x approaches zero for negative non-integer a. The solution type (e.g.,
        integer or non-integer) and normalization of Ja(x) are defined by its properties 
        below. It is possible to define the function by its Taylor series expansion around 
        x = 0.
